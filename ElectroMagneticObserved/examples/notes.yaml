  The Data Model is intended to measure excessive electric and magnetic fields (EMFs), radiation in a work or public environment according to the level of exposure to electromagnetic fields in the air (`inside` or `outside`).  For the attributes `eMF`, there are various ways they can be actually measured. For this purpose the `measurementType` Meta Data Attribute can be used. It can have the following values
    - Instant.	From the specific instant of time
    - average.	The average of a time period
    - maximum.	The maximum of a time period
    - minimum.	The minimum of a time period.

  When using the [average, minimum, maximum] values another Meta Data attribute called `measurementInterval` should be used to give the length of the measurement period in Seconds.
  Also the `timestamp` Meta Data attribute should be the end time of the measurement period.

  The frequency of the hertzian waves is conventionally lower than 300 GHz, propagating in space without artificial guide. They are between 9 kHz and 300 GHz.

  The following attributes are used to qualify the measurements and must be part of the description of the [device] as a configuration element.
  - FrequencyBands 	Range of limits for the frequency.
  - Lower. Unit Code Mega Hertz (MHz)
  - Higher. Unit Code Giga Hertz (A86)
  - detectionLimits	Range of limits for the detection limits.
      - Lower. Unit Code Volt Per Meter (D50)
      - Higher. Unit Code Volt Per Meter (D50)
  - Installation. How the device is installed
      - C1. Positioning of the device in relation to a ground reference system.
      - Value = Ground, Wall, Pole, aerial, roofing, other
      - C2. Positioning of the device in relation to an external / internal reference
      - Value = Inside / Outside
