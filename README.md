# dataModel.Environment
These data models describe the main entities involved with smart applications that deal with environmental issues.

### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [AeroAllergenObserved](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Environment/blob/master/AeroAllergenObserved/README.md). This data model has been developed based on
[GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/). Aero allergens strictly depends
on the geographical location. Common Aero allergens in Europe may be quite
different from the ones in US due to the different biological species. A list of
commonly used aero allergens in Europe can be found on
[polleninfo.org](https://www.polleninfo.org/en/allergy/profiles/) a web site
maintained by the European Aeroallergen Network. A World Health Organization
(WHO) Allergen Nomenclature (covering not only aero transported allergens) is
available at [http://www.allergen.org](http://www.allergen.org).


- [AirQualityObserved](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Environment/blob/master/AirQualityObserved/README.md). An observation of air quality conditions at a certain place and time.

- [NoiseLevelObserved](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Environment/blob/master/NoiseLevelObserved/README.md). It represents an observation of those acoustic parameters that estimate noise pressure levels at a certain place and time.
This entity is primarily associated with the Smart City and environment vertical segments and related IoT applications.


- [WaterObserved](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Environment/blob/master/WaterObserved/README.md).  Water observation data model is intended to represent the parameters of flow, level and volume of water observed, as well as the swell information, over a fixed or variable area. This observation also includes the masses of floating objects on this area. The data collected is provided by Sensors, Cameras,Water stations positioned at specific or sensitive locations for rivers, streams, torrent, lakes, seas, etc.

- [WaterQualityObserved](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Environment/blob/master/WaterQualityObserved/README.md). Water Quality data model is intended to represent water quality parameters
at a certain water mass (river,  lake, sea, etc.) section




### Incubated data models
The list of incubated (on development) data models are:

  - [PhreaticObserved_incubated](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Environment/tree/master/PhreaticObserved_incubated)

  - [RainFallRadarObservation_incubated](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Environment/tree/master/RainFallRadarObservation_incubated)
