# Environment Harmonized Data Models

These data models describe the main entities involved with smart applications
that deal with environmental issues.

The main entities identified are:

-   [AeroAllergenObserved](./AeroAllergenObserved/doc/spec.md). It describes
    aero allergens observed at a given location and related overall allergen
    risk.
-   [AirQualityObserved](./AirQualityObserved/doc/spec.md). It represents an
    observation of air quality conditions at a certain place and time.
-   [WaterQualityObserved](./WaterQualityObserved/doc/spec.md). Allows to
    capture all the parameters involved in Water Quality scenarios, allowing to
    deal with different scenarios: + Rivers and lakes. + Reservoirs like dams,
    cisterns, impoudments. + Sea locations. + Swimming pools or fountains.
-   [NoiseLevelObserved](./NoiseLevelObserved/doc/spec.md). It represents an
    observation of those parameters that estimate noise pressure levels at a
    certain place and time.
-   [WaterObseravation](WaterObserved/doc/spec.md). is intended to represent 
    the parameters of flow, level and volume of water observed, as well as the swell 
    information, over a fixed or variable area.
