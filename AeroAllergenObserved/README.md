# AeroAllergenObserved

## Description 

This data model has been developed based on
[GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/). Aero allergens strictly depends
on the geographical location. Common Aero allergens in Europe may be quite
different from the ones in US due to the different biological species. A list of
commonly used aero allergens in Europe can be found on
[polleninfo.org](https://www.polleninfo.org/en/allergy/profiles/) a web site
maintained by the European Aeroallergen Network. A World Health Organization
(WHO) Allergen Nomenclature (covering not only aero transported allergens) is
available at [http://www.allergen.org](http://www.allergen.org).
